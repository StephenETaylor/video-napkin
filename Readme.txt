The open-source club will attempt a video hack-a-thon on our first Tuesday
meeting in January, to do some video output from the DE2 board to a monitor
using the vga video output plug, or maybe the composite video.

Wikipedia article on VGA and VGA-connector is good.
the DE2_pin_assignments.csv file shows a VGA_Clk and other, presumably output
VGA signals, as well as OTG_*, which I think stands for USB on-the-go.

I'd like to try for some test patterns:

all red
all white

horizontal stripes
vertical stripes
